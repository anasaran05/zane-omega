| --- | --- |
| **D1 Discover** | The launch is far behind plan with $1.46B at risk because patients aren’t getting their medicine and the targeting strategy is outdated. |
| **D2 Diagnose** | The gaps come from four drivers: 51 percent pharmacy/HUB leakage, 29 percent poor targeting, 14 percent mixed value stories, and 6 percent minor issues. |
| **D3 Design** | Fix the patient-journey flow, launch the new AI targeting engine, and roll out one unified medical-commercial narrative. |
| **D4 Deploy** | In 100 days, repair top pharmacy contracts, automate the HUB process, launch AI targeting nationwide, and activate the unified value story. |
